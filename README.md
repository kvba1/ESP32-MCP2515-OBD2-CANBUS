# ESP32-MCP2515-OBD2-CANBUS
This repository contains code and documentation for a vehicle diagnostics tool that interfaces with the On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD-II) system using an MCP2515 CAN Controller and an Arduino microcontroller. The project aims to read real-time vehicle data such as speed, engine RPM, and coolant temperature directly from the vehicle's OBD-II port.

Key Features:

    Data Acquisition: Reads real-time data from a vehicleâ€™s OBD-II system.
    Vehicle Parameters: Extracts vehicle speed, engine RPM, and coolant temperature.
    MCP2515 CAN Controller: Utilizes the MCP2515 for efficient CAN bus communication.
    Arduino Integration: Leverages an Arduino board for processing and control.
    SPI Communication: Employs SPI protocol for microcontroller communication.

Hardware Components:

    MCP2515 CAN Controller Module
    ESP32 Board
    OBD-II Connector
    Necessary wiring and power supply
